file says survey(1) because I downloaded my original submission (which didn't have the image), but then went back and downloaded my second submission (image included)
I didn't specify action or method attributes as those weren't a requisite of the project (also, to what web domain that I own? Lol)

I guess I could always get a domain and a hosting service for a couple of my future projects...
